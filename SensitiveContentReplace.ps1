    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Replace sensitive information in all files in a folder with a generic mask value

    .DESCRIPTION
        This function take a directory parameter and then parses all files found for specified values and replaces them with a generic value so that the log file 
        can be shared with an audience that is not permitted to see sensitive data (database names, server names, IP addresses, etc)
        
    .EXAMPLE
        Assert-DataMask C:\Temp\TVP\Destination

        All files found in the specified directory will be parsed for values found in a lookup list and replaced with generated, generic values

    .INPUTS
        A valid local directory unc

    .OUTPUTS
        a MaskedValues.txt file is created giving the data owner a mapping reference between the sensitive value and the mask value that has been used

    .NOTES
        All target files are altered

        TODO:: 
            Add a -copy switch to allow the source file to remain untouched. Until then, the assumption is that we are working on a copy of the original anyway
